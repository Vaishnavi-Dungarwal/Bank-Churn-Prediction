Customer Churn Prediction using ANN and H2O AutoML


Context
Customer churn, a crucial metric in businesses, represents the degree of customer inactivity or disengagement observed over a specific period. It can manifest in various forms, such as the recency of account actions or changes in the account balance. This project focuses on identifying the factors contributing to customer churn and building a predictive model to classify if a customer is likely to churn.


Aim
The primary objectives of this study are as follows:
1. Identify and Visualize Factors: We will analyze and visualize the factors that contribute to customer churn, gaining insights into the drivers of disengagement.
2. Build a Prediction Model: We aim to create a prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that can accurately classify if a customer is likely to churn.
3. Probability of Churn: Preferably, based on model performance, we will choose a model that assigns a probability of churn. This will help customer service target low-hanging fruits to prevent churn effectively.


Time Line of the Project
1. Data Analysis: In this phase, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the customer churn dataset. Exploratory data analysis will help us understand the data distribution and the relationship between different variables and customer churn.
2. Feature Engineering: We will perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model. This step includes data transformation, handling missing values, and creating new relevant features.
3. Model Building using ANN: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) will be employed to develop the predictive model. ANN can effectively capture complex patterns in the data, enabling accurate classification of customer churn.
4. Model Building and Prediction using H2O AutoML: H2O AutoML, an automated machine learning library, will be utilized to explore various model architectures and hyperparameters. This will help us identify the best-performing model for customer churn prediction.
